# Task4.1P

This is a simple calculator microservice using Node.js and Express for ST1233-Task 4.1P.

Firstly, I imported Express and created the app. And then set up 4 basic calculator functions including add/subtrat/multiply/divide. Also has 400 error checking when user inputs something which is not a number such as "a".

To run it, you should open the terminal and type node server.js Then, open the website: http://localhost:8080/*****

If you want to use those functions, you should replace "******" to "function name"?num1="a number"&num2="a number"

For example: Visit http://localhost:8080/multiply?num1=908num2=62 to know the result about multiplying 90 and 62  

Visit http://localhost:8080/subtract?num1=818num2=34 to know the result about subtracting 81 and 34  



# Task4.2C

Add additional 3 calculator functions including Power, Sort and Modulo Also has 400 error checking when user inputs something which is not a number like "b". And the number which is moduled couldn't be zero  

For example: Visit http://localhost:8080/sqrt?num=81 know the result about sorting 81  

Visit http://localhost:8080/power?num1=28num2=11 to know the result about 2^11
